**Research on Mimica and Process Standardization**

 **Overview of the Challenge**

 The user has been assigned a take‑home challenge as part of an interview for a **Lead Product Manager** role at **Mimica**. Mimica builds an AI‑powered **task‑mining and process‑intelligence** platform that records every click, keystroke and screen an employee interacts with and uses this data to automatically generate end‑to‑end process maps and identify automation opportunities. The new **Analytics Platform** described in the challenge seeks to unlock additional value from this rich data by enabling global organisations to **standardise a business process across multiple regions** and surface insights beyond automation (e.g., bottlenecks, error sources, training needs).

 The assignment asks the candidate to propose and prototype a V1 feature for this analytics platform. The candidate must identify target personas, prioritise capabilities for a minimum viable product, explore trade‑offs, sketch a wireframe, define success metrics and build a launch plan. The challenge emphasises thinking critically about **user value**, **technical feasibility** and **trade‑offs** within a 6‑month runway with four engineers and one designer.

 **Mimica – what the product does**

 Mimica positions itself as an **AI‑powered task‑mining and process‑mapping platform**. Its core workflow can be summarised as follows:

1. **Recording desktop work** – The Mimica recorder is deployed on employee desktops and captures every click and keystroke across all applications and web pages. The company highlights that setup is simple (“**simply download and launch**”) with minimal security hurdles[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Simple%20set) and that the recorder can scale to **thousands of desktops**[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Built%20to%20scale).

2. **Unprecedented detail** – Mimica goes beyond system event logs by capturing **all desktop interactions** (clicks, keystrokes and actions)[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Go%20far%20beyond%20system%20event,work%20across%20the%20entire%20desktop). This data provides a complete picture of how tasks are actually performed.

3. **AI‑generated process maps** – Mimica’s **Mapper** module automatically synthesises the recorded task data into **end‑to‑end process maps**, including decision points, exceptions and variants[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Mapper). These maps distil variation between team members into a single representation and measure each step by **time spent**, **cost**, **application used**, **frequency**, **automatability** and other metrics[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=,insights%20to%20accelerate%20automation%20deployments).

4. **Actionable scoring metrics** – Mimica applies proprietary scoring to prioritise improvement opportunities for **immediate return on investment**[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Smart%20recommendations). These metrics distinguish value‑added vs. non‑value‑added activities[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=,improve%20processes%2C%20including%20GenAI%2C%20OCR) and recommend the right technology (e.g., GenAI, OCR, RPA) to improve processes[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=,GenAI%2C%20OCR%2C%20IDP%2C%20and%20RPA).

5. **Export and integration** – The platform supports exporting insights in **PDD**, **BPMN** or **CSV** formats[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Easy%20exports), enabling integration with automation and workflow‑visualisation tools. Outputs can feed intelligent automation platforms, BPM tools or business‑intelligence dashboards[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Outputs%20include%3A).

6. **Privacy and security** – Mimica automatically **anonymises personally identifiable information (PII)** and lets team members control when recording occurs (start, pause or turn off)[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Built%20for%20employee%20privacy). Specific applications or websites can be excluded from recording[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Data%20Exclusion), and the platform is compliant with enterprise‑grade security standards[mimica.ai](https://www.mimica.ai/product#:~:text=Built%20for%20employee%20privacy).

The current Mimica dashboard (depicted in the screenshots) shows a list of recorded processes (e.g., “Create Purchase Order” as‑is and to‑be versions) with metrics like **ease** of automation, **automatability**, **time spent** per year, and **time saved** per SME per day. The right‑hand panel summarises high‑level metrics for a selected process: total SMEs recorded, frequency per day, time saved (e.g., 1301 hrs/year), distribution of actions vs. semi‑structured inputs vs. decisions, and usage breakdown by application (e.g., SAP, Outlook, File Explorer, Adobe Acrobat). Another tab allows users to explore individual **transactions** (i.e., recorded task executions) with attributes like duration, recording time and screenshots of each step. The **flowchart** view shows a hierarchical process map with steps and decision points; selecting a step reveals details such as step ID, execution time, automata­bility and supporting screenshots of the actual desktop.

 **Types of data Mimica collects**

* **User interactions** – every click, keystroke and desktop action across all applications; these are time‑stamped and associated with specific steps in a task sequence.

* **Screen content** – periodic screenshots or screen recordings provide visual context for each step and allow the system to understand which application or website was used.

* **Meta‑data about applications** – the recorder identifies which application or website is in focus, enabling metrics about application usage.

* **User context** – information about the SME performing the task (anonymised), the task instance (transaction ID), duration and start/end timestamps.

This granular data forms the basis for deriving **process steps**, **decision paths**, **branch probabilities**, **time spent per step**, **application usage**, **frequency** and **automata­bility** metrics.

 **Process Standardization – objectives and challenges**

 The challenge emphasises the value of **process standardisation**. Standardisation aims to ensure that all regions follow the same efficient procedures, leading to:

* **Consistency and quality** – uniform procedures improve output quality and ensure compliance with regulatory and company standards.

* **Efficiency** – identifying and adopting the most efficient practices reduces time and resource consumption.

* **Scalability** – standard processes are easier to replicate across new regions or departments.

* **Transparency** – visibility into how processes are performed enables better management and decision‑making.

However, standardisation faces obstacles such as **diverse existing practices**, **resistance to change**, **complexity of data collection and analysis** and the **challenges of rolling out new procedures** across regions. Key roles involved in standardisation include **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** who perform the tasks, **Process Analysts** who investigate workflows, **Operations Managers** who own the process and enforce compliance, **Transformation Leads** who oversee change initiatives and **Compliance Officers** who ensure regulatory alignment.

 **Example: Invoice Validation workflow**

 The challenge provides a simplified **Invoice Validation** process as an example. The steps include:

1. **Open the newest vendor invoice email and save the attached PDF invoice.**

2. **In SAP, search for the vendor and invoice number to confirm it was not already actioned.**

3. **Compare the invoice total to the purchase order; if the difference exceeds a tolerance, email the buyer and stop.**

4. **Attach the PDF invoice in SAP.**

5. **Append the SAP document to a SharePoint invoice log and archive the email.**

This workflow illustrates how Mimica captures cross‑application actions (email client, SAP, SharePoint) and decisions (tolerance threshold) to build a comprehensive process map. Similar tasks would be captured in the “Create Purchase Order” process seen in the screenshots.

 **Synthesis**

 The challenge requires leveraging Mimica’s rich task‑level data to **enable process standardisation across regions**. Achieving this will involve:

* **Generating synthetic task data** to prototype analytics: we need to infer the structure of Mimica’s data (sequences of steps with timestamps, actions, decisions, applications used, durations, etc.) and create a synthetic dataset representing multiple regional variations of a process.

* **Defining metrics and insights** that help organisations compare process variants, identify bottlenecks and standardise on best practices. Mimica’s existing metrics (time spent, automata­bility, frequency, application usage) provide a foundation.

* **Designing an analytics platform** that allows stakeholders (process analysts, operations managers, transformation leads, compliance officers) to explore differences across regions, simulate the impact of adopting a standard process and measure progress over time.

Next, we will analyse the entities involved, perform deeper research and develop a structured plan to address the challenge.

 **Synthetic Data Design**

 To explore the proposed analytics features without access to real Mimica data, we generated a **synthetic dataset** that reflects the structure of Mimica’s recordings. The dataset focuses on the **Invoice Validation** process and models how the process might vary across five regions (Americas, EMEA, APAC, LATAM and North America). Key design elements include:

* **Schema** – Each row in the dataset represents a single step executed within a transaction. Columns include:

  * `task_id` – name of the task (`invoice_validation`).

  * `transaction_id` – unique identifier for each end‑to‑end task execution (300 transactions in total).

  * `region` – region where the task was performed (five regions).

  * `employee_id` – anonymised identifier for the SME who executed the transaction.

  * `variant` – label indicating whether the transaction follows the standard path or one of four variants (e.g., extra approval step, local log, early termination, initial summarisation).

  * `step_index` – ordinal position of the step within the transaction.

  * `action_name` – descriptive name of the action (e.g., `open_email`, `save_pdf`, `search_invoice_sap`).

  * `application` – application used for the step (Email Client, SAP, SharePoint, Excel).

  * `duration_sec` – simulated duration of the step in seconds, sampled from normal distributions calibrated per application type.

  * `start_time`/`end_time` – relative start and end times of the step within the transaction.

  * `decision_outcome` – for the `compare_totals` action, indicates whether the invoice total exceeded the tolerance (`exceeds_tolerance`) or not (`within_tolerance`); blank for other actions.

  * `automata_score` – synthetic score representing how automatable the step is (values drawn from 0 to 1 based on the nature of the action).

* **Variants & Regional Differences** – To mimic real‑world heterogeneity, the synthetic dataset introduces four variations beyond the standard flow:

  * **Variant 1** – inserts a `supervisor_approval` step after the totals comparison (e.g., in LATAM or Americas). Represents regions where an extra sign‑off is required.

  * **Variant 2** – replaces the `update_log` (SharePoint) step with `update_local_log` in Excel, simulating regions that maintain a local spreadsheet rather than the corporate SharePoint.

  * **Variant 3** – branches early when the invoice exceeds a tolerance threshold; transactions following this variant stop after the `compare_totals` step without attaching the invoice or updating logs.

  * **Variant 4** – adds a `summarise_invoice` step at the beginning, where users manually summarise invoice details in Excel before proceeding.

* Probabilities for each variant were assigned per region to reflect different regional practices (e.g., Americas more likely to use extra approvals, APAC more likely to perform an initial summary). Each transaction’s variant was sampled according to these probabilities.

* **Size** – The dataset contains **300 transactions** (60 per region) and **2,081 step rows**. Durations were sampled to be realistic (e.g., SAP steps average \~30 s, email steps \~15 s), and tolerance exceedance was set at \~15 % of transactions.

This synthetic dataset will be used to build mock analytics assets (dashboards, variant trees, flowchart overlays) and to test the feasibility of the proposed features in subsequent sections.

Tree‑of‑Thought mapping major entities and relationships:  
 **Tree‑of‑Thought Map for Mimica Analytics Challenge**

 The tree‑of‑thought diagram below identifies the key entities and their relationships in the context of Mimica’s analytics platform and the process standardisation challenge. Each entity satisfies the criteria of being **relevant**, **specific**, **novel** and **faithful** to the source material.

 **1\. Mimica Platform**

* **Recorder** – desktop agent that captures clicks, keystrokes and screen context. Feeds raw data into the platform.

* **Data types** – user interactions, screen content, application meta‑data, user context.

* **Modules** – **Miner** (extract tasks and identify inefficiencies), **Mapper** (generate process maps with decision points and variants), **Measure** (benchmark processes and monitor conformance over time).

* **Metrics & scoring** – time spent, cost, frequency, automata­bility, action counts, decision counts, semi‑structured inputs, application usage; proprietary ROI scoring.

* **Exports** – PDD/BPMN/CSV formats for integration.

* **Privacy controls** – PII anonymization, user control (start/pause), application exclusions.

**2\. Analytics Platform (new)**

* **Purpose** – empower enterprises to standardise processes across regions using task‑level data.

**4\. Data & Analysis**

* **Step records** – ordered sequence of actions per transaction with timestamps, durations, applications and screenshots.

* **Decision points** – conditional branches (e.g., tolerance threshold) with probabilities and outcomes.

* **Variants** – alternative paths taken by different users or regions; captured through multiple transactions.

* **Aggregated metrics** – total time per step, distribution across users/regions, frequency of each path, automata­bility percentage.

* **Derived insights** – bottlenecks (steps with high time or variance), redundant actions, high‑impact differences between regions, recommended best practice.

**5\. Example Entities**

* **Region A variant** – e.g., adds extra approval step, longer time spent in SAP.

* **Region B variant** – e.g., uses local spreadsheet for log instead of SharePoint.

* **Decision tolerance** – percentage threshold for invoice difference; influences branching.

* **Application mix** – proportion of steps performed in SAP vs. email vs. Excel vs. SharePoint.

* **Automatability score** – rating indicating how suitable each step is for automation, used to prioritise improvement.

**Relationships**

* The **Recorder** captures data that populates the **Data types** nodes.

* **Data types** feed into **Miner**, **Mapper** and **Measure**, producing metrics used by the **Analytics Platform**.

* **Analytics Platform** uses aggregated metrics to deliver insights for **Process Standardization** and cross‑region comparisons.

* **Roles** interact with the **Analytics Platform**: SMEs supply data; process analysts interpret findings; operations managers enforce standards; transformation leads drive change; compliance officers ensure the new standard meets regulations.

* **Process Standardization** feeds back into the **Recorder** and **Data types** through refined procedures and training materials, creating a continuous improvement cycle.

Brainstorming and feature prioritisation document:  
 **Brainstorming Potential Features for the Analytics Platform**

 This document lists candidate user features and product capabilities for the proposed analytics platform. For each item we estimate its **value** (impact to users) and **effort** (technical complexity and development cost) on a 1–10 scale (10 \= highest). The rationale notes why the feature matters and any risks or dependencies.

| \# | Feature / Capability | Description | Value (1–10) | Effort (1–10) | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | **Cross‑Region Comparison Dashboard** | A dashboard that aggregates process metrics (e.g., cycle time, time spent per step, variant frequency, error rates) by region. Users can filter by region, timeframe and step and quickly identify differences across geographies. | **9** | **5** | High value because standardisation requires understanding how regions differ. Data is already captured; the main work involves building aggregations and a visual layer. |
| 2 | **Variant Cluster Analysis** | Use clustering algorithms to group transactions into distinct variants and visualise their paths. Highlight the frequency and cost of each variant and map them back to regions or teams. | **8** | **7** | Enables discovery of hidden patterns and outlier behaviours. Requires algorithm development and UX for variant trees. |
| 3 | **Bottleneck & Waste Detection** | Automatically flag steps with high time consumption, long queues, or redundant actions. Provide drill‑down into root causes and suggest fixes. | **9** | **6** | Directly targets efficiency improvements. Data required (time per step) already exists; the challenge is defining thresholds and presenting insights clearly. |
| 4 | **Standard‑to‑Actual Gap Analysis** | After a “best‑practice” workflow is defined, monitor conformance by comparing real transactions to the standard. Generate conformance scores, heatmaps of deviations, and alerts for non‑compliance. | **8** | **7** | Essential for enforcing a new process but depends on the existence of a defined standard. Conformance checking algorithms (similar to process mining) need to be developed. |
| 5 | **Recommendation Engine for Standardisation** | Use data to propose a recommended global process. Combine high‑frequency paths with best performance metrics and simulate the impact of adopting this standard on different regions. | **7** | **8** | Offers prescriptive guidance but is algorithmically complex (optimisation, simulation). May be deferred to later versions. |
| 6 | **Training Material Generator** | Automatically generate step‑by‑step guides or micro‑learning modules from the standard process, including anonymised screenshots and decision logic. Tailor training per region. | **6** | **6** | Supports adoption of the new process and leverages existing screenshots. Moderate effort but may not be as high‑value as analytical features in v1. |
| 7 | **Interactive Flowchart Overlay** | Enhance the existing flowchart with overlays showing differences across regions (colour‑coded paths, per‑region statistics). Users can switch between “all”, “region A”, “region B”, etc. and see where paths diverge. | **8** | **6** | Improves interpretability of differences. Requires UI work and dynamic data binding but builds upon current flowchart. |
| 8 | **Continuous Monitoring & Alerts** | Provide real‑time monitoring of processes after standardisation. Trigger alerts when metrics fall outside thresholds or when new variants emerge. | **7** | **7** | Valuable for long‑term governance but depends on sustained data capture and may be better suited for a later release. |

 **Ranking and Recommendations**

 Based on the value/effort scores, the features providing the highest impact for a v1 within a 6‑month runway are:

1. **Cross‑Region Comparison Dashboard (Feature 1\)** – high value and moderate effort; foundational for understanding variation and prioritising improvements.

2. **Variant Cluster Analysis (Feature 2\)** – uncovers hidden differences; together with Feature 1, this helps identify which regions deviate from the desired flow.

3. **Bottleneck & Waste Detection (Feature 3\)** – directly highlights high‑impact inefficiencies; implementation leverages existing timing data.

4. **Interactive Flowchart Overlay (Feature 7\)** – enhances the existing map to visualise regional differences without building an entirely new page.

Features like the **Standard‑to‑Actual Gap Analysis (4)** and **Training Material Generator (6)** are important but may require a defined standard and thus could be targeted for a v2. The **Recommendation Engine (5)** and **Continuous Monitoring (8)** are more advanced and may have lower short‑term ROI relative to their complexity.

Planning document with expert critiques and task breakdown:

10. **Outline a launch plan and milestones** for delivering v1 within six months.

11. **List unknowns and propose a learning plan** (research/experiments) to address them.

12. **Generate deliverables** – slides or a report summarising all the above; synthetic dataset; mock analytics assets (e.g., simplified process map with overlays, dashboards); technical implementation plan for a Next.js demo.

**2\. Expert Panel**

 To ensure a comprehensive plan, we convene a virtual panel of experts with the following perspectives:

* **Requirements Expert** – ensures the platform meets the needs of all stakeholders and adheres to the problem statement.

* **Architecture Expert** – advises on data structures, modelling approaches and scalability for the synthetic dataset and future platform.

* **Performance Expert** – evaluates computational efficiency of algorithms (e.g., clustering, conformance checking).

* **Tooling Expert** – advises on libraries/frameworks (e.g., Next.js, charts, process mining libraries) and integration with Mimica’s exports (CSV/BPMN).

* **Design/UX Expert** – critiques the wireframe and ensures the interface is intuitive and accessible for non‑technical users.

* **Product Vision Expert** – aligns features with Mimica’s strategic goals and market positioning.

* **Domain Expert** – provides insights into finance operations and process standardisation challenges across regions.

The experts will review the plan (see section 4\) and provide feedback; their recommendations will be documented and incorporated.

 **3\. Key Milestones**

1. **Context Gathering (complete)** – summarised Mimica’s capabilities and process standardisation objectives in RESEARCH.md.

2. **Tree‑of‑Thought Construction (complete)** – mapped entities and relationships in TOT.md.

3. **Brainstorming & Feature Prioritisation (complete)** – generated and ranked candidate features in BRAINSTORM.md.

4. **Synthetic Data Design** – define data schema; generate synthetic transactions representing multiple regions; incorporate variations, decisions and metrics.

5. **Mock Analytics Assets** – create simple dashboards/plots (e.g., region comparison chart, variant tree) and a mock process map overlay, using the synthetic dataset.

6. **MVP Definition & Trade‑off Analysis** – articulate problem & personas; select top features for v1; deep dive into one feature’s trade‑offs.

7. **Wireframe & User Flow** – sketch a low‑fidelity wireframe of the analytics platform (likely using a simple diagram or slide; can be drawn with Python or imported image assets) and describe the user journey.

8. **Metrics & Launch Plan** – define north‑star metric and KPIs; draft timeline and milestones for a six‑month v1 release.

9. **Unknowns & Learning Plan** – list open questions and propose experiments or stakeholder conversations.

10. **Technical Implementation Plan** – outline how to build a Next.js demo using CLaude code, including data loading, state management, visualisations and interactions.

11. **Generate Final Deliverables** – compile slides or report summarising all findings and prototypes. Synchronise files via `computer.sync_file` and deliver to the user.

**4\. Expert Review Feedback**

 After sharing the initial plan with the experts, the following feedback was gathered:

* **Requirements Expert:** Emphasised the need to keep the user personas front and centre and to tie every feature back to specific user pain points. Recommended focusing v1 on comparative insights (differences and bottlenecks) rather than prescriptive recommendations.

* **Architecture Expert:** Suggested designing the synthetic dataset using a modular schema (Task → Transaction → Step) with attributes like `region`, `timestamp`, `application`, `action_type`, `decision_outcome`, `duration` and `auto_score`. Encouraged storing the dataset in JSON or CSV for easy loading in both Python and Next.js.

* **Performance Expert:** Warned that clustering algorithms can be computationally expensive; recommended using simple heuristics (e.g., grouping by step sequences) for variant analysis in v1. For the demo, small datasets are fine.

* **Tooling Expert:** Recommended using **Plotly.js** or **Chart.js** for interactive charts in Next.js; emphasised that process maps could be simplified to Sankey diagrams or flowcharts using a library like **react‑flow**. For synthetic data generation and mock analytics, Python’s `pandas` and `networkx` can be used.

* **Design/UX Expert:** Highlighted that non‑technical stakeholders need intuitive visual cues (e.g., colour coding for regions, clear legends). Wireframes should prioritise comparison views and minimise clutter.

* **Product Vision Expert:** Advised aligning the new analytics platform with Mimica’s brand promise of “fast time‑to‑value”; thus, early releases should deliver immediate insights without heavy configuration. Emphasised ease of adoption.

* **Domain Expert:** Noted that in finance processes, regional variations often stem from regulatory requirements and local supplier relationships. The analytics should allow segmentation not only by region but also by vendor type or invoice category.

This feedback has been incorporated into the tasks and prioritisation.

 **5\. Plan Refinements**

 Based on the expert feedback, the plan focuses on delivering **comparative analytics** and **bottleneck identification** in v1, leaving advanced recommendations and training generation for later iterations. The synthetic dataset will be designed to reflect realistic regional variations, and the user interface will centre on dashboards and interactive flowcharts with region overlays.

 **6\. Next Steps**

 Refer to the **todo.md** file for a detailed task list. Tasks will be marked complete as they are executed. The deliverables will be generated iteratively, with intermediate results saved in the appropriate files.

Detailed analysis report, trade‑offs, user flow, success metrics and launch plan:  
 **Draft Analysis Text for Final Deliverables**

 **1\. Problem & First‑Customer Fit**

 **User persona:** The primary persona for the v1 analytics platform is the **Process Analyst / Continuous‑Improvement Manager** responsible for global finance operations. This role investigates how work is currently performed, identifies inefficiencies, and recommends process changes. Secondary personas include **Transformation Leads** (who drive change initiatives) and **Operations Managers** (who own the process and enforce compliance). SMEs and Compliance Officers play supporting roles but are not the main consumers of analytics.

 **Primary problem:** Multinational organisations struggle to enforce a single “best practice” for invoice‑to‑pay or purchase‑order processes because each region has evolved its own workflows. Without objective data, it is impossible to compare how work is actually performed across teams. Leaders need to answer: *Where do our processes diverge? Which variants cause delays or errors? What would we gain by standardising on a best practice?* Existing process‑mining tools surface high‑level flows but lack the task‑level detail and cross‑regional comparisons necessary to make these decisions. Mimica’s task‑level data can fill this gap.

 **2\. MVP Capability Prioritisation**

 Based on the brainstorm, the following capabilities were considered. Each feature was scored for value (benefit to the user) and effort (development complexity) on a 1–10 scale. The top four are recommended for the V1 launch.

1. **Cross‑Region Comparison Dashboard (Value 9 / Effort 5\)** – summarises key metrics (cycle time, step durations, variant frequency, error rates) by region. Enables analysts to identify which regions differ most and where to focus standardisation efforts.

2. **Variant Cluster Analysis (8 / 7\)** – groups transactions into common variants and visualises their flows. Reveals hidden patterns and outliers; critical for understanding why processes diverge.

3. **Bottleneck & Waste Detection (9 / 6\)** – automatically flags slow or redundant steps across regions and quantifies their impact. Helps prioritise which steps to optimise.

4. **Interactive Flowchart Overlay (8 / 6\)** – builds upon Mimica’s existing flowchart by layering region‑specific paths and statistics. Users can toggle regions to see where deviations occur. Improves interpretability without reinventing the map.

5. **Standard‑to‑Actual Gap Analysis (8 / 7\)** – once a standard is defined, measures conformance and highlights deviations.

6. **Training Material Generator (6 / 6\)** – produces step‑by‑step guides from the standard process, using anonymised screenshots.

7. **Recommendation Engine (7 / 8\)** – suggests an optimal global process by combining high‑frequency paths with performance metrics.

8. **Continuous Monitoring & Alerts (7 / 7\)** – tracks ongoing conformance and triggers alerts when new variants emerge.

**MVP selection:** For a six‑month v1 with four engineers and one designer, the first four features deliver the highest value for moderate effort. They provide immediate, actionable insights and leverage Mimica’s existing data and visualisations. Gap analysis and training generation depend on having a defined standard and are better suited for a subsequent release. Recommendation engines and continuous monitoring introduce algorithmic complexity and can be targeted for v2.

 **3\. Trade‑off Decision (Variant Cluster Analysis)**

 **Feature description:** Variant cluster analysis groups similar transaction paths together using a clustering algorithm and displays each variant’s frequency, average duration and regional distribution. Analysts can drill into any variant to view its flow and compare it with the standard.

 **Value estimation:** This feature is highly valuable because process variation is the heart of the standardisation problem. Without seeing the different ways a task is executed, an analyst cannot decide which practices to adopt. Clustering identifies hidden patterns that may not be apparent from raw metrics. It also helps quantify the “long tail” of rare variants that could be eliminated.

 **Effort estimation:** Implementation requires designing a similarity measure for step sequences (e.g., Levenshtein distance on action names) and running a clustering algorithm (e.g., hierarchical clustering or k‑modes). The UI must present the results intuitively (e.g., variant tree or list). For a v1, we can simplify by grouping transactions based on exact step sequences and frequencies, avoiding heavy algorithms. Data volumes in a pilot (hundreds of transactions) are manageable.

 **Trade‑offs:** Including this feature in v1 increases complexity but delivers critical insight. Excluding it would force analysts to manually inspect variants, undermining the platform’s value. To mitigate risk, we propose a phased approach: start with simple grouping by unique step sequences and gradually evolve to more advanced clustering in later releases. Performance concerns can be addressed by preprocessing variants offline and caching results. The risk of confusing users can be mitigated by providing clear explanations and linking each variant to its region distribution.

 **4\. Wireframe & User Flow**

 The low‑fidelity wireframe (see `wireframe_dashboard.png`) illustrates the proposed analytics dashboard. The **navigation sidebar** lets users select a process (e.g., “Invoice Validation”). The **header** displays the platform name and context. The main area is divided into several panels:

1. **Region Comparison** – a bar chart showing average transaction duration per region. Users can switch the metric to view total cycle time, error rates or cost per transaction.

2. **Variant Distribution** – a stacked bar chart showing the number of transactions per variant in each region. Users can click a bar to drill into a specific variant and see its flow.

3. **Bottlenecks** – a table listing steps with the highest average duration or variance, along with the regions where they occur most frequently. Users can sort or filter the table.

4. **Process Map Overlay** – an interactive flowchart built upon Mimica’s Mapper, with colours indicating which regions follow each path. Hovering over a step shows metrics (time, frequency, automata score) and variant membership.

5. **Recommendations & Actions** – a panel summarising insights, suggested standard practices, and export options (e.g., export variant data to CSV or BPMN for further analysis).

**User flow:**

1. The analyst selects “Invoice Validation” from the sidebar. The dashboard populates with aggregated metrics for all regions.

2. They note that LATAM has the longest cycle time in the Region Comparison chart and that Variant 1 dominates in this region.

3. Clicking the LATAM bar filters all panels to show data for LATAM. The Bottlenecks panel highlights that the `supervisor_approval` step (Variant 1\) is a major contributor to cycle time.

4. In the Process Map Overlay, the analyst toggles between LATAM and EMEA to see that EMEA lacks the extra approval step. They decide to investigate whether LATAM’s approval is necessary or could be streamlined.

5. The analyst exports the variant data and schedules a meeting with the transformation lead and compliance officer to discuss harmonising the process.

**5\. Success Metrics**

 **North‑star metric:** *Reduction in cross‑regional process variation index* – a composite measure that quantifies how closely each region’s execution of a process aligns with the defined standard. It could be calculated as the weighted average of conformance scores across regions.

 **Leading KPIs:**

1. **Average cycle time by region** – track reductions in time to complete the process after standardisation.

2. **Number of variants per process** – aim to reduce the number of distinct variants as processes are harmonised.

3. **Time saved / cost savings identified** – quantify the potential or actual savings from eliminating bottlenecks and redundant steps.

4. **Adoption rate of the standard process** – percentage of transactions matching the standard variant after deployment; monitored over time.
