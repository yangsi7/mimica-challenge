# Gap Analysis: Current Implementation vs Requirements
Date: 2025-01-30

## AGENT TASK / GOALS / REQUIREMENTS / DELIVERABLES

### Primary Goal
Build a Mimica Analytics Platform that:
1. **Phase 1**: Exactly clones Mimica's existing Mapper module UI (process list, summary panel, process map)
2. **Phase 2**: Extends with cross-region process standardization analytics

### Deliverables
- Pixel-perfect clone of Mimica platform UI from screenshots
- Interactive process map visualization with React Flow
- Cross-region analytics dashboard processing the full synthetic dataset
- Modern, professional UI using prebuilt components from 21st.dev
- Complete documentation and testing

### Key Findings from Screenshots

#### Image1.png - Process List View
- Left sidebar with MINER/MAPPER tabs (MAPPER active)
- Process list table with columns: Name, Ease (badge), Automatability (badge), Time Spent
- Right panel shows summary with:
  - Time Saved metric (1301 hrs/y)
  - Ease of Deployment gauge (Medium)
  - Count cards in grid layout
  - Applications/Websites donut charts

#### Image2.png - Process Map View
- Interactive node-based process flow diagram
- Nodes connected with lines showing process flow
- Color-coded nodes (blue, orange, yellow)
- Right panel shows step details
- Toolbar on left side

#### Image3.png - Transaction View
- Detailed transaction list/spreadsheet view
- Color-coded rows
- Screenshot panels on right
- Excel spreadsheet integration

## CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Process Map Visualization (MISSING ENTIRELY)
**Current**: Placeholder text "Process map visualization coming soon..."
**Required**: Full React Flow implementation with:
- Interactive node-based diagram
- Color-coded nodes by automation score
- Connection paths between steps
- Zoom/pan controls
- Step details panel
- Variant overlay capability

### 2. Data Processing Issues
**Current**: Only processing 2 mock processes, minimal data utilization
**Required**: Process ALL 4,153 steps from new_synthetic_invoice_data.json:
- Group by transaction_id
- Calculate real metrics per process
- Generate variant paths
- Identify actual bottlenecks
- Compute automation scores

### 3. UI/UX Fidelity
**Current**: Basic implementation, not matching Mimica's polished UI
**Required**: 
- Exact color scheme from screenshots
- Proper spacing and typography
- Professional badges and cards
- Smooth interactions
- Modern component library usage

### 4. Missing Features
- Transaction detail view
- Variant paths visualization
- Step details panel
- Export functionality
- Real-time metric updates
- Proper data aggregation

### 5. Component Quality
**Current**: Hand-coded basic components
**Required**: Use 21st.dev MCP tools for modern, prebuilt components

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

1. **Rushed Implementation**: Focused on getting something working rather than matching requirements
2. **Ignored Visual References**: Did not properly analyze and replicate screenshots
3. **Minimal Data Usage**: Only created mock data instead of processing the full dataset
4. **No Process Map**: Skipped the most complex and important visualization
5. **Manual Coding**: Didn't leverage 21st.dev component library tools

## REMEDIATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Process Map Implementation (Priority 1)
1. Install and configure react-flow-renderer
2. Process step data to create node/edge structure
3. Implement interactive process map matching Image2.png
4. Add step details panel
5. Implement zoom/pan controls
6. Color-code by automation score

### Phase 2: Data Processing Overhaul
1. Load and process ALL data from new_synthetic_invoice_data.json
2. Group steps by transaction_id and task_id
3. Calculate real metrics (not mock data)
4. Generate variant paths from actual data
5. Identify real bottlenecks from step durations

### Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancement
1. Use 21st.dev component builder for all UI elements
2. Match exact colors and spacing from screenshots
3. Implement proper badges with correct styling
4. Add smooth transitions and interactions
5. Ensure pixel-perfect alignment

### Phase 4: Missing Features
1. Add transaction detail view
2. Implement variant overlay on map
3. Add export functionality
4. Complete all placeholder sections

## NEXT STEPS

1. Start with Process Map implementation using React Flow
2. Refactor data processing to use full dataset
3. Rebuild UI components using 21st.dev tools
4. Conduct visual validation against screenshots
5. Test all interactions and data flows
