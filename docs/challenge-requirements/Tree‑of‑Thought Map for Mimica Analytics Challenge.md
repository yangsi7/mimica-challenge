*  **Tree‑of‑Thought Map for Mimica Analytics Challenge**

   The tree‑of‑thought diagram below identifies the key entities and their relationships in the context of Mimica’s analytics platform and the process standardisation challenge. Each entity satisfies the criteria of being **relevant**, **specific**, **novel** and **faithful** to the source material.

   **1\. Mimica Platform**

  1. **Recorder** – desktop agent that captures clicks, keystrokes and screen context. Feeds raw data into the platform.

  2. **Data types** – user interactions, screen content, application meta‑data, user context.

  3. **Modules** – **Miner** (extract tasks and identify inefficiencies), **Mapper** (generate process maps with decision points and variants), **Measure** (benchmark processes and monitor conformance over time).

  4. **Metrics & scoring** – time spent, cost, frequency, automata­bility, action counts, decision counts, semi‑structured inputs, application usage; proprietary ROI scoring.

  5. **Exports** – PDD/BPMN/CSV formats for integration.

  6. **Privacy controls** – PII anonymization, user control (start/pause), application exclusions.

* **2\. Analytics Platform (new)**

  1. **Purpose** – empower enterprises to standardise processes across regions using task‑level data.

  2. **Personas** – process analyst, operations manager, transformation lead, compliance officer, subject matter expert.

  3. **Capabilities** – cross‑region comparison, bottleneck identification, variant analysis, standard‑to‑actual gap analysis, recommendations for standardisation, training content generation.

  4. **Visualisations** – process map overlays by region, dashboards summarising metrics, heatmaps of time spent, variance trees, decision path comparisons.

  5. **Outputs** – reports on best‑practice workflows, change management plans, training materials.

* **3\. Process Standardization**

  1. **Objectives** – consistency & quality, efficiency, compliance, scalability, transparency.

  2. **Challenges** – diverse practices, resistance to change, data collection complexity, implementation hurdles.

  3. **Roles** – SME (executes the process), process analyst (investigates workflows), operations manager (owns the process), transformation lead (drives change), compliance officer (ensures regulatory alignment).

  4. **Workflow example** – Invoice Validation (steps: open email, search vendor in SAP, compare invoice to PO with tolerance check, attach invoice, update SharePoint log).

* **4\. Data & Analysis**

  1. **Step records** – ordered sequence of actions per transaction with timestamps, durations, applications and (in Mimica’s case) screenshots. Each record now includes **user\_id**, **role** (AP clerk, manager, supervisor, analyst) and **variant** label in addition to the original fields. The dataset used for prototyping comprises \~4 k rows for 500 transactions.

  2. **Decision points** – conditional branches (e.g., tolerance threshold) with probabilities and outcomes (`within_tolerance`, `exceeds_tolerance`, `requires_review`). These drive variant selection and step skipping in some paths.

  3. **Variants** – alternative paths taken by different users or regions; captured through multiple transactions. The improved mock data models five variants: **A** (standard path), **B** (requires second approval), **C** (adds local log entry), **D** (early termination when tolerance exceeded) and **E** (compiles summary report). Variant sampling is region‑dependent.

  4. **Aggregated metrics** – per‑transaction totals (duration, step count, automata score), region‑level averages (mean, median, min, max), variant distribution across regions, and step‑level statistics (average duration, frequency). These feed visual components such as cross‑region dashboards and bottleneck tables.

  5. **Derived insights** – identification of bottlenecks (steps with high average duration like `manager_approval` and `send_for_review`), redundant actions, high‑impact differences between regions (e.g., LATAM performs more variant C transactions), and recommendations for a harmonised best practice. The new data pipeline produces ready‑to‑use JSONs for each visual component (region metrics, variant distribution, variant metrics, bottleneck list, step‑level metrics).

* **5\. Example Entities**

  1. **Region A variant** – e.g., adds extra approval step, longer time spent in SAP.

  2. **Region B variant** – e.g., uses local spreadsheet for log instead of SharePoint.

  3. **Decision tolerance** – percentage threshold for invoice difference; influences branching.

  4. **Application mix** – proportion of steps performed in SAP vs. email vs. Excel vs. SharePoint.

  5. **Automatability score** – rating indicating how suitable each step is for automation, used to prioritise improvement.

* **Relationships**

  1. The **Recorder** captures data that populates the **Data types** nodes.

  2. **Data types** feed into **Miner**, **Mapper** and **Measure**, producing metrics used by the **Analytics Platform**.

  3. **Analytics Platform** uses aggregated metrics to deliver insights for **Process Standardization** and cross‑region comparisons.

  4. **Roles** interact with the **Analytics Platform**: SMEs supply data; process analysts interpret findings; operations managers enforce standards; transformation leads drive change; compliance officers ensure the new standard meets regulations.

  5. **Process Standardization** feeds back into the **Recorder** and **Data types** through refined procedures and training materials, creating a continuous improvement cycle.
